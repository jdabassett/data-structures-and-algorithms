## Linked-List

### Title:
Linked-List Insert, Includes, __str__

#### Date: 10-01-2023

#### Problem
Write classes to create Node and Linked Lists instances.
Create methods to insert, search if value exists and to return string representation of the linked list.

#### Approach & Efficiency
  * LinkedList.insert(value):
    * Time Complexity: O(1)
    * Space Complexity: O(1)
  * LinkedList.includes(value):
    * Time Complexity: O(n)
    * Space Complexity: O(1)
  * LinkedList.to_string()
    * Time Complexity: O(n)
    * Space Complexity: O(n)
