# Data Structures:

## Linked-List

### Title:
Linked-List Insert, Includes, __str__

#### Date: 10-01-2023

#### Problem
Write classes to create Node and Linked Lists instances.
Create methods to insert, search if value exists and to return string representation of the linked list.

#### Approach & Efficiency
  * LinkedList.insert(value):
    * Time Complexity: O(1)
    * Space Complexity: O(1)
  * LinkedList.includes(value):
    * Time Complexity: O(n)
    * Space Complexity: O(1)
  * LinkedList.to_string()
    * Time Complexity: O(n)
    * Space Complexity: O(n)


### Title:
Linked-List-Insertions

#### Date:
10/05/2023

#### Problem
Create methods to delete a node, insert a node at end of linked-list, insert a node before a node that matches a given value, and after the same matching node.

#### Approach & Efficiency
  * LinkedList.append():
    * Time Complexity: O(n)
    * Space Complexity: O(1)
  * LinkedList.insert_before():
    * Time Complexity: O(n)
    * Space Complexity: O(1)
  * LinkedList.insert_after():
    * Time Complexity: O(n)
    * Space Complexity: O(1)
  * LinkedList.delete():
    * Time Complexity: O(n)
    * Space Complexity: O(1)


### Title:
Linked-List-Kth

#### Date:
10/06/2023

#### Problem
Find and return the kth from end node of the linked list.

#### Whiteboard

#### Approach & Efficiency
  * LinkedList.kth_from_end():
    * Time Complexity: O(n)
    * Space Complexity: O(n)
